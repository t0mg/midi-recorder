# Web MIDI Recorder

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/t0mg/midi-recorder/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/t0mg/midi-recorder/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

A simple web-based application for recording, playing, saving, and exporting MIDI data from MIDI devices over USB.

It is useable directly from https://t0mg.github.io/midi-recorder/

This small app was a weekend experiment made entirely on my phone using [AI studio](aistudio.google.com), [Jules](jules.google.com), and a pinch of tedious manual editing.

## Features

- Connect to MIDI input and output devices.
- Record MIDI performances.
- Playback recorded MIDI data.
- Save recordings in the browser's local storage.
- Export recordings as MIDI files (`.mid`).
- Import MIDI files.
- Auto-record on MIDI input.
